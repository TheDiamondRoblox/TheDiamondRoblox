# About TheDiamondRoblox

> Hi, nice to meet you. I am TheDiamondRoblox, I have extensive knowledge in technology and accounting. With great leadership experience in real life, I manage and moderate 3 Discord Partnered servers with 100k+ members each. I balance academics with my hobbies like programming and social media. Discord is my main platform. I'm a YouTube Gaming Partnered Creator and a former Minecraft player who still rules Cubecraft's Eggwars Mega Leaderboards.

It's been a passion and a journey I've learned a lot from while using Discord. I've spent over 2 years online, I am so experienced that I can know what kind of person someone is by just reading few of their messages! I have talked to over 3,000 users in DMs.

If you need help in servers I moderate, feel free to reach out via DMs. As a staff member, I exercise my best practices to assist. I acknowledge my responsibilities as a moderator, so don't hesitate to contact me for any moderation-related help. I have years of experience fighting against injustice, delivering justice, conducting investigations, and enforcing rules and terms of service.
